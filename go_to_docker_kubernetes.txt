This is how you take a small server and make a Docker container of it then run the container on Minikube.

1. Take the contents of the file called goWebServer.go make a file with it goWebServer.go

Have go installed on your system first and run it to ensure there are no errors.

  go run goWebServer.go

2. Take the contents of the file called Dockerfile and name it Dockerfile. This is in the same directory.

3. Log into docker in your terminal.

   docker login -u <yourDockerHubUserName>

4. Now to build the Dockerfile to ensure it runs and there are no errors in the Dockerfile.

   docker build -t <yourDockerHubUserName>/gowebserverproject:latest .

5. Now to push this to your DockerHub repo. This will be visible in your UI and public on your repo at hub.docker.com so you know.
   docker push <yourDockerHubUserName>/gowebserverproject:latest

6. Pull the repo local
   docker pull <yourDockerHubUserName>/gowebserverproject:latest

7. Run the container to ensure you see the Hello output.
   docker run -i -t -p8080:8081 <yourDockerHubUserName/gowebserverproject:latest

8. Now for Kubernetes. Have minikube installed.

9. Create your Deployment
  kubectl create deployment gowebserver --image=<yourDockerHubUserName>/gowebserverproject:latest

10. Check to ensure the pod is there and created properly.
  kubectl get pods

11. Expose your service.
  kubectl expose deployment gowebserver --type=LoadBalancer --port=8081

12. Start you application.
  minikube service gowebserver

13. Cntrl C out of everywhere and run kubectl delete service gowebserver

14. If you'd like to re run this since your Deployment is there check that your pod is there and then run thru steps 11 and 12.
